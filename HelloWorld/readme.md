| literal            | A value of some type <br> Examples of numeric literals are: 1, 42, 98.04 <br> Examples of sting literals are "Hello, world", "Guido van Rossum","Python"                                                                                                                     |
| function           | A named block  of code that we can call, by using its name. <br> we can write our own functions, or we can use functions that are built into python (such as **print**)<br> in Python, all functions **return** a value                                                      |
| arguments          | A value passed to a **function**, in order to give it values to work with. <br> There may be no **arguments**, or there may be 1 or more. Arguments appear in parentheses after the **function** name <br> if there are no arguments, you still have to type the parentheses |
| calling a function | Using the **function** name to execute the function's code. <br> when you **call** a function you have to provide the **arguments** that the function expects. <br> if it doesn't expect any arguments,don't put anything between the parentheses.                           |
| return value       | The value that a **function** returns.<br> we haven't talked about that yet, but it belongs in this slide, to make the slide complete                                                                                                                                        |            
| parameter          | Also called **formal parameter** <br> This is something else we haven't discussed yet, and we'll learn about **parameters** when we write out own functions.                                                                                                                 |
